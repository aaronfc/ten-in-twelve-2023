Ten In Twelve 2023
==================

Ten projects during december 2023. Inspired by [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and also my previous [Lunar Challenge](https://aaron.com.es/blog/the-lunar-challenge/).

## Description

I asked ChatGPT to generate a list of 10 simple webapp project ideas. I will try to build them during december 2023.

## Ideas

Copy-pasted from ChatGPT:

```
1. *Task Tracker*: Create a simple web app for tracking daily tasks with features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

2. *Weather App*: Build a weather application that fetches data from a weather API and displays the current weather conditions based on user location.

3. *Recipe Book*: Develop a web app where users can input, save, and categorize their favorite recipes, including ingredients and instructions.

4. *Book Wishlist*: Design a virtual book wishlist where users can add and remove books they want to read, with brief descriptions and cover images.

5. *Quote Generator*: Create an app that generates random inspirational or motivational quotes with a clean and minimalist design.
